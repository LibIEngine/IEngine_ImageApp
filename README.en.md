#### use
To use our code example. You may need to make some modifications. WINDOWS can be opened and compiled directly with VS, and LINUX can be compiled with commands  
Due to different environments, the directory structure of each user may be different. Therefore, the header file and the module directory are also different. Before you compile, you need to modify the loaded directory structure in our code according to your own directory structure to be correct Compile and use. Not only the loading directory of WINDOWS, but the compiling command of linux also needs to modify the directory address as needed.

## WINDOWS
To use it under WINDOWS, you need to install VS. You can directly to compile,provided that your engine directory is configured, and you need to modify the engine directory of the loaded header file to your own directory.
## LINUX
To use under LINUX. You can use the command to compile, gdb debugging. The compiled command is in the code. You can directly copy the commented compilation command, open the terminal, switch to the current directory, and type directly to compile.
